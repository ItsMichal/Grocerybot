Make sure your controller directory has the webserver, `grocery.py`, `our_urdf.urdf` and `templates/index.html` inside it to work.

# Instructions for Webserver

1. Run `server.py` on the same machine as Webots
    -   `py server.py`
2. Go to `localhost` in your browser for the shopping list.
3. Start the webots simulation
4. Click your shopping list and relax

If server isn't running, Webots defaults to oranges and beers. Additionally, you have about 30 seconds before it defaults as well.# Grocerybot
